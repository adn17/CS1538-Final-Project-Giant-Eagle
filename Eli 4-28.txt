The Simulation is (I think) done besides these few things:

+ Fit data to distributions
+ Add Random Draws
+ Add a way of storing results for each customer 

- Remove the test-type print statements
	
****Also I added an updated version of the giant eagle data we collected, with histograms and calculations
